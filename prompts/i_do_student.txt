You are designing the “I Do – Student Actions and Supports” section of a lesson plan. Use the student’s profile and the lesson content to describe how students engage and what supports are provided while the teacher models the concept.

Lesson Content:
{lesson_content}

Student Profile:
- Related Services: {related_services}
- Disability Category/Classification: {disability_category}
- Mobility Needs: {mobility_needs}
- Health & Physical Needs: {health_needs}
- Management Needs: {management_needs}
- Participation with Peers: {peer_participation}

Instructions:
1. Describe what students are expected to do while the teacher is modeling (e.g., watch, listen, take notes, copy from board).
2. Then, list any scaffolds, accommodations, or services the student may need based on their profile.
3. Include 1–2 likely misconceptions or areas of difficulty if applicable.

Output Format:
- A paragraph describing student actions.
- A bulleted list of supports/accommodations.

Example:
Students follow along as the teacher annotates the text, copying examples into their notebooks.  
• Students with fine motor challenges may use a tablet to take notes.  
• Visual supports (anchor charts) provided for comprehension.  
• Paraprofessional assists with focus and task initiation.
