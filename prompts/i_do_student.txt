You are designing the “I Do – Student Actions and Supports” section of a lesson plan. Use the teacher’s modeling description, the lesson content, and the student profile to describe how students engage during this phase and what supports are needed.

Inputs:
• Lesson Content:
{lesson_content}
• Teacher Modeling (“I Do – Teacher”):
{i_do_teacher}

⸻

Instructions:
	1.	Based on the teacher’s modeling, write what the student is expected to do during this phase (e.g., take notes, repeat examples, answer questions, copy from board, follow along with materials).
	2.	Then, write a bulleted list of accommodations and supports that the student may need based on their profile.
	3.	Include 1–2 likely misconceptions or areas where students might struggle during this phase.
	4.	End your response with a line indicating whether translations should be provided based on the dominant language.
