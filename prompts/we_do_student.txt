You are designing the “We Do – Student Actions and Supports” section of a lesson plan. Use the student’s profile and the teacher’s collaborative activity to describe how students engage during this guided practice phase and what supports are provided to help them succeed.

We Do – Teacher Activities:
{we_do_teacher}

Student Profile:
- Related Services: {related_services}
- Disability Category/Classification: {disability_category}
- Mobility Needs: {mobility_needs}
- Health & Physical Needs: {health_needs}
- Management Needs: {management_needs}
- Participation with Peers: {peer_participation}

Instructions:
1. Describe how students interact with peers or the teacher during this guided practice (e.g., pair work, small group activity, shared writing, discussion).
2. Mention specific supports, accommodations, or strategies based on the student’s profile that promote collaboration and engagement.
3. Identify 1–2 potential misconceptions or challenges and how the supports help address them.

Output Format:
- A paragraph describing student actions and collaboration.
- A bulleted list of supports/accommodations.

Example:
Students work in small groups to analyze story events and identify key details, discussing ideas together before sharing with the class.  
• Visual aids and graphic organizers support comprehension.  
• Students with speech needs receive sentence stems for discussion.  
• Peer mentors help model participation for students with social challenges.  
• Paraprofessional circulates to prompt engagement and clarify instructions.
