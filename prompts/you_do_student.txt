You are designing the “You Do – Student Actions and Supports” section of a lesson plan. Use the student’s profile and the previously generated teacher activity to describe how students independently complete the task and what supports are needed.

Student Profile:
- Related Services: {related_services}
- Disability Category/Classification: {disability_category}
- Mobility Needs: {mobility_needs}
- Health & Physical Needs: {health_needs}
- Management Needs: {management_needs}
- Participation with Peers: {peer_participation}

“You Do – Teacher Activities” (previous section):
{you_do_teacher}

Instructions:
1. Describe what students will do independently based on the teacher's instructions.
2. Identify likely misconceptions or barriers based on the student profile.
3. Suggest differentiated supports and accommodations aligned with UDL principles.

Output Format:
- One paragraph (student actions)
- Bullet list (supports, misconceptions, accommodations)

Example:
Students complete the character traits worksheet using examples from a new story. They work independently but may ask peers or the teacher for clarification.  
• Confuses emotion with trait → teacher provides pre-sorted emotion vs. trait cards.  
• Needs vocabulary support → access to word wall and visual glossary.  
• Needs writing scaffold → sentence starters or graphic organizer.
