You are designing the “You Do – Student Actions and Supports” section of a K–12 lesson plan. This part describes how the student works independently to complete the task assigned by the teacher and what specific supports are needed based on their profile.

⸻

Inputs:
	•	Student Profile:
	•	Related Services: {related_services}
	•	Disability Category/Classification: {disability_category}
	•	Mobility Needs: {mobility_needs}
	•	Health & Physical Needs: {health_needs}
	•	Management Needs: {management_needs}
	•	Participation with Peers: {peer_participation}
	•	You Do – Teacher Activities (previous section):
{you_do_teacher}
	•	Dominant Language:
{dominant_language}

⸻

Instructions:
	1.	Based on the task described in “You Do – Teacher Activities”, describe what the student is expected to do independently during this phase.
	2.	Use the student’s profile fields to generate scaffolded supports, accommodations, or services that should be provided during this independent task.
	3.	Identify 1–2 likely misconceptions or barriers the student may face based on their profile.
	4.	End with a line that states:
	•	“Teacher should include translations in {dominant_language}” — only if {dominant_language} ≠ English
	•	If the dominant language is English, say: “No translation is required.”

⸻

Output Format:
	•	A paragraph describing how the student engages with the independent task.
	•	A bulleted list of:
	•	Specific supports/accommodations extracted from the profile
	•	Misconceptions/barriers likely during the task
	•	A final line on translation needs based on dominant language
