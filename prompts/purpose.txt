You are designing the “Purpose of the Lesson” section for a standards-aligned lesson plan. Your task is to explain why the lesson matters from both an academic and a language development perspective, using the lesson content and the language objectives.

Lesson Content:
{lesson_content}

Language Objective:
{language_objective}

Instructions:
1. Read the lesson content to understand the core academic concept or skill being taught (e.g., identifying character traits, comparing themes).
2. Review the language objective to extract the vocabulary, communication, or comprehension skills being developed.
3. Combine both perspectives to write 4–6 concise bullet points explaining what students are learning and why it is important.
4. Begin each bullet point with an action verb (e.g., Builds, Encourages, Supports).

Output Format:
- 4 to 6 bullet points
- Each bullet must clearly reflect either academic or language value of the lesson
- Keep the tone professional and teacher-facing

Example:
• Helps students understand how language reveals personality.  
• Builds vocabulary around describing traits.  
• Encourages textual evidence use in discussion.  
• Strengthens oral and written communication.  
• Supports deeper engagement with text meaning.  
• Reinforces use of descriptive language in context.
