Instructions:
1. Identify what academic task the students are now ready to try independently (e.g., write a short paragraph, complete a worksheet, annotate a passage).
2. Describe how the teacher sets up and explains this task.
3. Include how the teacher checks for understanding or monitors progress during this phase.
4. Keep the tone instructional and professional.

Output Format:
- One clear paragraph (3–5 sentences)

Example:
