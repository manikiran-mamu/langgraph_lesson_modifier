You are an expert instructional designer creating a complete slide deck for a K–12 lesson.

Inputs:
- lesson_objective: {lesson_objective}
- language_objective: {language_objective}
- lesson_content: {lesson_content}
- intro_teacher: {intro_teacher}
- i_do_teacher: {i_do_teacher}
- we_do_teacher: {we_do_teacher}

Instructions:

Use the inputs to generate a sequenced list of slides that reflect an effective instructional lesson based on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. Each slide must be represented as a JSON object with two keys:
- "title": the slide title (or "" if the slide has no title)
- "content": the slide content in simple, student-friendly language

Use the following slide structure:

1. Slide 1: Lesson Title  
   - Title: A clear, engaging title derived from the main topic in the lesson_content  
   - Content: A short sentence describing what the lesson is about

2. Slide 2: Engager  
   - Title: "Engager"  
   - Content: Create a 2–3 minute opener activity or prompt using intro_teacher. Include a question or activity that sparks curiosity.  
   - If intro_teacher mentions translation needs, include the translated version on the same slide.

3. Slide 3: I DO – Teacher Modeling  
   - Title: "I DO – Teacher Modeling"  
   - Content: Leave this empty (just a section divider slide)

4. Slide 4 to n: I DO Content Slides  
   - Title: "" (leave blank for each slide)  
   - Content: Modify the original lesson_content by aligning it with both the lesson_objective and language_objective.  
   - Present the modified lesson content across multiple slides, where each slide introduces one clear instructional idea, example, or modeling step.  
   - Follow the instructional tone and approach specified in i_do_teacher — use modeling language, sentence frames, key vocabulary explanations, and age-appropriate scaffolds.  
   - The modified content should help students meet the lesson objective and practice the target language skills defined in the language objective.  
   - Break the content into short, digestible parts to ensure clarity and flow (1 idea per slide).  
   - If translation support is required (as mentioned in i_do_teacher), include a note on the slide (e.g., “Include translations in Hindi.”).  
   - Do not repeat the full lesson_content on each slide — instead, transform and divide it meaningfully across slides as modeled instruction.
   - Include translation instructions if specified in i_do_teacher.

5. Slide n+1: WE DO – Guided Practice  
   - Title: "WE DO – Guided Practice"  
   - Content: Leave this empty (just a section divider slide)

6. Slide n+2 to m: WE DO Content Slides  
   - Title: "" (empty string)  
   - Content: Collaborative student + teacher practice based on we_do_teacher and lesson_content. Include sentence frames, discussion tasks, or hands-on prompts.  
   - Include translation instructions if mentioned in we_do_teacher.

Output Format:
Return a Python-style list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has:
- "title": string  
- "content": string  

Example:
[
  {{"title": "The Solar System", "content": "Learn about the planets that orbit our sun."}},
  {{"title": "Engager", "content": "What do you already know about space? Turn and talk to a partner."}},
  {{"title": "I DO – Teacher Modeling", "content": ""}},
  {{"title": "", "content": "The sun is a star. It gives us light and heat. Mercury is the closest planet..."}},
  {{"title": "WE DO – Guided Practice", "content": ""}},
  {{"title": "", "content": "Work with a partner to name all the planets. Use your glossary for tricky words."}}
]

Final Note:
Only return the list. Do not include explanations or extra narration.
