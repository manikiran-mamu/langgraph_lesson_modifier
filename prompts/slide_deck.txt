You are an expert instructional designer creating a complete slide deck for a K–12 lesson.

Inputs:
- lesson_objective: {lesson_objective}
- language_objective: {language_objective}
- lesson_content: {lesson_content}
- intro_teacher: {intro_teacher}
- i_do_teacher: {i_do_teacher}
- we_do_teacher: {we_do_teacher}

Instructions:

Use the inputs to generate a sequenced list of slides that reflect an effective instructional lesson based on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. Each slide must be represented as a JSON object with two keys:
- "title": the slide title (or "" if the slide has no title)
- "content": the slide content in simple, student-friendly language

Use the following slide structure:

1. Slide 1: Lesson Title  
   - Title: A clear, engaging title derived from the main topic in the lesson_content  
   - Content: A short sentence describing what the lesson is about

2. Slide 2: Engager  
   - Title: "Engager"  
   - Content: Create a 2–3 minute opener activity or prompt using intro_teacher. Include a question or activity that sparks curiosity.  
   - If intro_teacher mentions translation needs, include the translated version on the same slide.

3. Slide 3: I DO – Teacher Modeling  
   - Title: "I DO – Teacher Modeling"  
   - Content: Leave this empty (just a section divider slide)

4. Slide 4 to n: I DO Content Slides  
   - Title: "" (leave blank for each slide)  
   - Content: Rewrite and adapt the entire lesson_content so that every key idea, event, or passage is represented somewhere across these slides.  
   - The goal is to transform (not shorten) the full lesson_content so it becomes clear, accessible, and instructionally aligned with both the lesson_objective and the language_objective.  
   - Use i_do_teacher as the teaching model for tone and delivery — the teacher is modeling comprehension strategies, vocabulary use, and thinking processes aloud.  
   - Keep all original details from the story, but express them using simpler language, scaffolds, and sentence frames that help students meet the objectives.  
   - Divide the rewritten lesson_content logically across multiple slides — one paragraph, event, or concept per slide — so that nothing is skipped or summarized away.  
   - Each slide should contain a short chunk of the rephrased story or concept (3–6 sentences) written in clear, student‑friendly language.  
   - Integrate vocabulary definitions, visuals, or quick comprehension checks where appropriate.  
   - Explicitly connect the text to the lesson_objective and the language_objective (for example, highlight how the vocabulary or theme supports them).  
   - If translation support is required (as noted in i_do_teacher), end the slide content with a note such as “Include translations in Hindi.”  
   - The result should be a complete, modified version of the lesson_content distributed across the slides — preserving all information but rewritten for accessibility and learning focus.

5. Slide n+1: WE DO – Guided Practice  
   - Title: "WE DO – Guided Practice"  
   - Content: Leave this empty (just a section divider slide)

6. Slide n+2 to m: WE DO Content Slides  
   - Title: "" (empty string)  
   - Content: Collaborative student + teacher practice based on we_do_teacher and lesson_content. Include sentence frames, discussion tasks, or hands-on prompts.  
   - Include translation instructions if mentioned in we_do_teacher.

Output Format:
Return a Python-style list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has:
- "title": string  
- "content": string  

Example:
[
  {{"title": "The Solar System", "content": "Learn about the planets that orbit our sun."}},
  {{"title": "Engager", "content": "What do you already know about space? Turn and talk to a partner."}},
  {{"title": "I DO – Teacher Modeling", "content": ""}},
  {{"title": "", "content": "The sun is a star. It gives us light and heat. Mercury is the closest planet..."}},
  {{"title": "WE DO – Guided Practice", "content": ""}},
  {{"title": "", "content": "Work with a partner to name all the planets. Use your glossary for tricky words."}}
]

Final Note:
Only return the list. Do not include explanations or extra narration.
