You are an expert instructional designer creating a complete slide deck for a K–12 lesson.

Inputs:
- lesson_objective: {lesson_objective}
- language_objective: {language_objective}
- lesson_content: {lesson_content}
- intro_teacher: {intro_teacher}
- we_do_teacher: {we_do_teacher}

Instructions:

Use the inputs to generate a sequenced list of slides that reflect an effective instructional lesson based on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. Each slide must be represented as a JSON object with two keys:
- "title": the slide title (or "" if the slide has no title)
- "content": the slide content in simple, student-friendly language

Use the following slide structure:

1. Slide 1: Lesson Title  
   - Title: A clear, engaging title derived from the main topic in the lesson_content  
   - Content: Leave this empty
   - If intro_teacher mentions translation needs, include the translated version on the same slide.
   

2. Slide 2: Engager  
   - Title: "Engager"  
   - Content: Create a 2–3 minute opener activity or prompt using intro_teacher. Include a question or activity that sparks curiosity.  
   - If intro_teacher mentions translation needs, include the translated version on the same slide.

3. Slide 3: I DO – Teacher Modeling  
   - Title: "I DO"  
   - Content: Leave this empty (just a section divider slide)

4. Slide 4: WE DO – Guided Practice  
   - Title: "WE DO"  
   - Content: Leave this empty (just a section divider slide)

5. Slide 5 to n: WE DO Content Slides  
   - Title: "" (empty string)  
   - Content: Collaborative student + teacher practice based on we_do_teacher and lesson_content. Include sentence frames, discussion tasks, or hands-on prompts.  
   - If we_do_teacher mentions translation needs, include the translated version on the same slide.

Output Format:
Return a Python-style list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has:
- "title": string  
- "content": string  

Example:
[
  {{"title": "The Solar System\n\n Translated Version"}},
  {{"title": "Engager", "content": "What do you already know about space? Turn and talk to a partner.\n\n Translated version"}},
  {{"title": "I DO", "content": ""}}
  {{"title": "WE DO", "content": ""}},
  {{"title": "", "content": "Work with a partner to name all the planets. Use your glossary for tricky words.\n\n Translated Version"}}
]

Final Note:
Only return the list. Do not include explanations or extra narration.
