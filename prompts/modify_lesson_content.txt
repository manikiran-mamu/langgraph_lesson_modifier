You are an expert K–12 curriculum designer and inclusive‑education specialist.  
Your task is to rewrite and adapt an entire lesson into **student‑ready instructional chunks** that can later be placed on slides during the “I DO” phase of instruction.

Inputs:
- lesson_content: {lesson_content}
- lesson_objective: {lesson_objective}
- language_objective: {language_objective}
- i_do_teacher: {i_do_teacher}

Goals:
Transform the entire lesson_content (every paragraph or event) into a clear, scaffolded instructional version that:
1. Retains all the information, sequence, and meaning from the original text.
2. Rephrases language for clarity, age‑appropriateness, and accessibility.
3. Integrates direct modeling, vocabulary support, and language scaffolds that help students meet both the lesson_objective and the language_objective.
4. Includes translation of each rewritten chunk into the dominant language *only if the i_do_teacher specifies translation support*.

### 1. Content Adaptation Guidelines
- **Preserve all story details.** No summarizing or skipping. Each paragraph or event from the lesson_content must appear somewhere in your rewritten version.
- **Simplify sentence structure** and clarify pronouns or references so the story is easier to follow.
- **Highlight key vocabulary words** in each section and briefly define them in student‑friendly terms.
- **Embed comprehension checks** (e.g., guiding questions or sentence frames such as “Icarus felt ___ because ___.”).
- **Align with lesson_objective.** Explicitly connect story moments to what students are learning (e.g., identifying character change, understanding cause and effect, recognizing descriptive language).
- **Align with language_objective.** Model use of target linguistic structures or academic vocabulary (e.g., comparative adjectives, sequencing words, or sentence starters).
- **Scaffold progressively.** Early slides should focus on comprehension and vocabulary, while later ones can model analysis and inference.

### 2. Translation Integration Rules
- If the i_do_teacher text includes a phrase like “Teacher should include translations in [Language]”,  
  then provide **both English and translated text** for every rewritten chunk.
- Format translations directly below the English version using this pattern:

- If no translation is required, output English only.

---

### 3. Structure and Segmentation
- Divide the rewritten lesson into logical **chunks or slides**, with one main idea per slide.
- Each slide must contain:
- **"title": ""**  (leave empty — titles will be added later)
- **"content":** rewritten instructional text (3–6 sentences)
- Keep the sequence faithful to the original narrative order.
- Each chunk must be self‑contained and readable on a single slide.
- Do **not** number or label slides; just output a clean JSON list.

### 4. Example of Ideal Output Format

[
{{
  "title": "",
  "content": "Daedalus was a brilliant inventor imprisoned by King Minos. He decided to escape by creating wings out of feathers and wax. The word *ingenious* means clever and creative. Students discuss how creativity can solve problems.  \nTranslation (Hindi): डेडलस एक प्रतिभाशाली आविष्कारक था जिसे किंग मिनोस ने कैद कर लिया था। उसने पंख और मोम से पंख बनाकर भागने का निर्णय लिया। *Ingenious* का अर्थ है चतुर और रचनात्मक। छात्र चर्चा करते हैं कि रचनात्मकता से समस्याओं का समाधान कैसे किया जा सकता है।"
}},
{{
  "title": "",
  "content": "Icarus helped gather feathers for his father. Together they built wings strong enough to lift them into the air. Daedalus taught Icarus how to fly carefully — not too high, not too low — to stay safe. What might happen if someone ignores directions?  \nTranslation (Hindi): इकरस ने अपने पिता की सहायता करते हुए पंख इकट्ठे किए। दोनों ने ऐसे पंख बनाए जो उन्हें हवा में उठा सकें। डेडलस ने इकरस को सावधानी से उड़ना सिखाया— न बहुत ऊँचा, न बहुत नीचे— ताकि वह सुरक्षित रहे। सोचिए: यदि कोई निर्देशों को अनदेखा करे तो क्या हो सकता है?"
}},

### 5. Output Requirements
- Return a **valid JSON list** of slide objects (each with `"title"` and `"content"`).
- The total rewritten output should collectively include the entire lesson_content (no parts omitted).
- Keep tone supportive, clear, and instructional — as if guiding students during a classroom “I DO” demonstration.
- Avoid meta explanations; just return the final JSON list.

---

### 6. Quality Expectations
- **Fidelity:** Every paragraph or event from lesson_content must be represented.
- **Readability:** Grades 4–8 level; short sentences, direct phrasing.
- **Alignment:** Consistently reinforce lesson_objective and language_objective throughout.
- **Inclusivity:** Maintain UDL principles — multimodal cues, sentence starters, visual or emotional prompts.
- **Translation accuracy:** When used, translations must preserve meaning and tone.
